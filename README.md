## Usage

Available commands:

- `npm run dev` runs the local development server
- `npm run stage` creates files without minifying the code - _( Files will be located in the "dist" folder )_
- `npm run prod` creates files ready for production - _( All the code will be minified. Files will be located in the "dist" folder )_
- `npm run test` runs unit test functions
- `npm run eslint` runs eslint checks

The last two commands are automatically invoked during the creation of a new git commit.

Always use the `git commit -m ""` command for creating new commits. Husky and Commitizen plugins will do the rest.
